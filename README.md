# nosqlconcepts

This project includes a unified environment that provides access to four databases (PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Neo4J, MongoDB). The application features a Learning Analytics Dashboard and digital assignment sheets where database queries can be executed, and the results can be displayed. Note that this is a work in progress.
